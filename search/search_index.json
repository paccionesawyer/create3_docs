Their purpose is to make sure that the robot does not get into dangerous sitations and it is able to detect and react properly to cliff hazards. Safety features are configurable by the user through a ROS 2 parameter. This will allow more adventurous users to have full control over the robot. Important The robot will temporarily re-enable all safety features whenever it is commanded to execute any of the built-in autonomous behaviors. The safety_override parameter exposed by the motion_control ROS 2 node should be used to control and override safety features. It's a string parameter and it accepts 3 possible values: none Safety features are fully enabled. This is the default value. backup_only Overrides the robot backup limit safety feature, disabling it. full Safety features are fully disabled. For example, in order to completely disable safety mechanisms: ros2 param set /motion_control safety_override full Note that the parameter server will reject changes if there are typos in the new safety value set by the users. The following sections briefly describe what the safety features do. Backup Limit Attention If you disable the backup limit, the robot will not stop if there are cliffs while driving backward! The Create\u00ae 3 robot is equipped with cliff sensors, but they are located only in the front of the robot. This means that the robot is not able to detect cliff hazards while driving backward. In order to make the robot safe, the robot's default policy is to never move backward further than what would be safe should there be a cliff directly behind the robot. Under standard circumstances, the robot is allowed to briefly move backward only if it has first traveled forward (i.e. if it has \"explored\" the space making sure that it does not present cliff hazards). If the robot is kidnapped (i.e. first lifted by the user and then placed somewhere), the backup limit will immediately trigger. The Create\u00ae 3 robot signals to the user when the backup limit is about to be triggered in multiple ways: Through the HazardDetectionsVector ROS 2 message: an hazard of type BACKUP_LIMIT will be published in the vector. By logging a warning message. By changing the color of the lights to orange. If the user ignores these alerts and keeps driving the robot backward, the robot will suddenly brake and come to a stop. From this point, the robot will refuse any backward movement. The user will have to drive the robot forward in order to re-enable backward movements. As soon as the user drives the robot forward, the lights will go back to the default white color. Safe backward movements will not be immediately re-allowed, but rather the robot will have to keep driving forward for a little while. This moment will be identified by the BACKUP_LIMIT hazard disappearing from the HazardDetectionsVector message. The backup limit and its related alerts are active only when safety_override = none . Maximum speed Attention If you increase the speed above the default one, the robot may not be able to stop in time when a cliff is detected! In order to stop when a cliff hazard is detected, it is also necessary to make sure that the robot is not driving too fast. Safety features will thus limit the robot speed. You can check the current maximum robot speed through the read-only parameter max_speed exposed by the motion_control ROS 2 node. When safety_override = none or safety_override = backup_only the maximum speed will be limited to 0.306 m/s. By fully disabling safety features, i.e. setting safety_override = full the robot will be allowed to drive at its true maximum speed of 0.460 m/s. Acceleration Limits The robot exposes its commanding acceleration limits through the wheel_accel_limit parameter on the motion_control node. The velocity commands sent to the wheels will be ramped with the acceleration profile associated with this value. The value defaults to its maximum settable 900 mm/s^2 . If using heavier payloads, it is advisable to decrease acceleration limits. E-Stop The robot exposes a service with name e_stop that when sent e_stop_on true will turn off the robot's wheels. The robot will not respond to velocity commands when e_stop_on is true. See EStop.srv For example, in order to enable the E-Stop: ros2 service call /e_stop \"{e_stop_on: true}\" Wheel Status There is a wheel_status topic which publishes WheelStatus.msg exposing whether the wheels are enabled (disabled if E-Stop is engaged) and the present PWM duty cycle and current through each wheel.","title":"Safety"},{"location":"api/safety/#create-3-safety-overrides","text":"By default, the Create\u00ae 3 robot has some safety features enabled.

The battery shipping with the robot is a 26 Wh, 4S Lithium Ion smart battery pack, with a nominal voltage of 14.4 V (12 V min, 16.8 V max). It will report a 0% state of charge when the total voltage of the pack reaches 12.0 V. It will self-protect and disconnect from any load at 10.8 V or lower. Charge the battery by placing Create\u00ae 3 on the included iRobot\u00ae Home Base\u2122 Charging Station. The light ring will show the state of charge and animate while the battery is charging. Notice Do not attempt to use the robot without its battery installed. Tip Keep the robot on the Home Base\u2122 charging station (or power down the robot by holding down the power button for 10 seconds) when not in use to prevent the battery from discharging. Adapter Board Overview The iRobot\u00ae Create\u00ae 3 robot has two electrical connections exposed via the Adapter Board. The connections are accessible within the robot once the cargo bay is removed. The Adapter Board is also visible through the top cover of the robot, where its indicators are visible, and the USB/BLE toggle can be switched. Power Connections Unregulated Battery Port The unregulated battery port is a JST XH-style connector, with pin 1 as the positive terminal of the battery, and pin 2 as the negative terminal. These terminals are labeled on the bottom side of the board and are visible with the robot on its back and the cargo bay removed. The board is capable of supplying a maximum of 2 A of current at the current battery voltage (14.4 V nominal, 12 V min, 16.8 V max), enforced by a PTC resettable fuse in the robot. This port is always on when the battery is powered on. Notice Do not back-feed power into the robot through this port, and do not attempt to use the robot without its battery installed. USB-C\u00ae Connector The USB-C\u00ae connector 1 provides a USB 2.0 Host connection into the robot with 5.13 V at 3.0 A provided to power downstream connections. The power is disabled on this port unless a proper USB-C\u00ae downstream device is connected. The 5 V source powering this port will shut off when the battery voltage falls below approximately 11.8 V. The USB data connection is made only when the USB/BLE toggle switch plunger is slid toward the USB icon. Total Power Output The USB-C\u00ae port draws its power from the unregulated battery connection which, as mentioned above, is limited to 2 A at the battery voltage. This means there is only around 28.8 W total power shared between both power outputs (assuming the battery is at 14.4 V). If power is drawn through the USB-C\u00ae connector, then less power is available through the unregulated battery port and vice versa. Example As an example, if a full 5 V @ 3 A are drawn from the USB-C\u00ae port, the battery is currently measuring 14.4 V, and the switching regulator is 90% efficient, then a maximum of (2 A - (5 V * 3 A / 0.90 / 14.4 V) =) 0.84 A can be drawn from the unregulated battery port before the resettable fuse will trip (and depending on ambient temperature, even more margin may be necessary). USB/BLE Toggle The USB/BLE toggle routes the robot's single USB Host connection either to the USB-C\u00ae port (useful for connecting to single-board computers with OTG or device ports) or to the on-board Bluetooth\u00ae Low Energy 2 module. This module can be used to interact with the iRobot Coding app . Indicators \ud83d\udfe0 Orange Indicator The orange indicator (D3) is illuminated when the USB-C\u00ae port is powering a downstream device, whether or not a data connection is being made. \ud83d\udfe1 Yellow Indicator The yellow indicator (D2) is illuminated when the robot's internal 5 V bus is enabled. There is an error if this LED is extinguished. \ud83d\udfe2 Green Indicator The green indicator (D300) is illuminated when the robot's battery is switched on. \ud83d\udd35 Blue Indicator The blue indicator (D6) is illuminated when the BLE radio is turned on. It flashes when it is connected to a host.

Here are some hookup examples. Raspberry Pi\u00ae The Raspberry Pi\u00ae mounting scheme does not match Create\u00ae 3's faceplate or cargo bay hole pattern; here are two 3D-printable mounts. The larger mount is more rigid but requires three times as much time to print. Small Mount (128kB) Large Mount (520kB) Raspberry Pi\u00ae 4 Since the Raspberry Pi\u00ae 4 has a USB-C\u00ae port capable of an OTG connection, a cable with a USB-C\u00ae connector on both ends is all that is required. The Raspberry Pi\u00ae is pictured in the cargo bay with the large mount, and the Adapter Board is removed from the robot for clarity. Raspberry Pi\u00ae 1-3 Model B The original Raspberry Pi\u00ae through the Raspberry Pi\u00ae 3 do not have upstream (device) ports, so it's a little more difficult to connect and power them cleanly. We suggest using a USB-C\u00ae hub which includes an integrated USB to Ethernet adapter as the cleanest way to go. It's also possible to power the Raspberry Pi\u00ae using the USB-C\u00ae port on the Adapter Board with the help of a downstream connection adapter like this one and make the data connection over Wi-Fi. Raspberry Pi\u00ae Zero This should be the same as the Raspberry Pi\u00ae 4.

NVIDIA\u00ae Jetson Nano\u2122 2GB The Jetson Nano\u2122 2GB has a USB-C\u00ae port (J2) for power and a USB Micro-B port (J13) for downstream data. This can be connected to the Create 3 most simply using a USB-C\u00ae hub and two cables -- USB A to Micro-B and USB A to USB-C\u00ae. NVIDIA\u00ae Jetson Xavier NX\u2122 Developer Kit The Jetson Xavier NX\u2122 Developer Kit has a 5.5mm x 2.5mm barrel connector jack (J16) for power (9 V to 20 V) and a USB Micro-B port (J5) for downstream data. This can be powered from the unregulated battery port of the Create\u00ae 3 adapter board by using a JST-XH female connector to DC barrel plug cable. The data connection is established by using a USB Micro B to USB-C\u00ae cable. Mounting NVIDIA\u00ae Jetson Xavier NX\u2122 Developer Kit You can 3d print the mount adapter to place the Jetson Xavier NX Developer Kit in the cargo bay or on the faceplate.

It is possible to use special self-tapping plastic screws (or in a pinch, sheet metal or wood screws) to screw through the cover into a 3D-printed boss. Many of our example STLs use this technique. Machine screws with nuts The Create\u00ae 3 robot's holes are sized for M3 or #4 screws. Cable ties Cable ties (also known as zip ties) can be threaded through the 3 mm holes. 2.5 mm widths are common and fit nicely. Twist ties Twist ties are a quick, cheap, and reusable way for holding wires or other non-structural pieces. Plastic Rivets Push-in, split-shank plastic rivets (either for M3 or 0.115\" holes) are fast and inexpensive ways to mount thin stock to the Create\u00ae 3 robot's faceplate. Highly sophisticated interlocking brick system The typical toy brick has its studs spaced at 8 mm, while Create\u00ae 3's holes are spaced at 12 mm.

Complete the getting started guide (listed above) until you complete the initial setup. Alter \"USB Device Mode\" to apply static IP To alter the Jetson's \"USB Device Mode\" feature (specifically, disabling DHCP server and self-assign a static IP address); First, create a flag file to store IP address for Jetson to be used with Create3. sudo bash -c 'echo \"192.168.186.3\" > /opt/nvidia/l4t-usb-device-mode/IP_ADDRESS_FOR_CREATE3_ROBOT.conf' Then, modify the \"nv-l4t-device-mode-runtime\" service script ( /opt/nvidia/l4t-usb-device-mode/nv-l4t-usb-device-mode-runtime-start.sh ). The complete file is here . Connect micro-B end of the USB cable from Create\u00ae 3 robot to the micro-B USB port of Jetson.

Note that if you have multiple robots, but they are not on the same network, then you can ignore this as they are effectively isolated. Attention If you have multiple Create\u00ae 3 robots connected to the same Wi-Fi network it is required to adopt at least one of the following procedures; otherwise, they will not work. Basic Concepts on ROS 2 Communication ROS 2 communication is based on the underlying DDS middleware. After two ROS processes discover each other, they will automatically start to communicate if their topics, services, or actions match. The default discovery protocol used by ROS 2 is based on broadcast. This means that when a ROS 2 process is started it will advertise its own discovery messages to all other ROS processes that are connected to the same network. The main advantage of using a broadcast discovery protocol is that as long as your ROS 2 processes are connected to the same network, they will automatically connect to each other and start to communicate. The basic use case does not require any special configuration from the user. Potential Problems with Multiple Robots Having ROS 2 processes automatically start communication is not always a good thing. Usually if two ROS 2 processes that are meant to be executed in isolation start communicating, they will end up mixing up messages between processes without being able to understand if what they are receiving was meant for them or for the other process (or in this case, robot). Important Create\u00ae 3 robots should never communicate with each other. There may be cases where two ROS 2 processes internal to a robot have no intention to communicate, but happen to do so since they have the same topic names and just happen to be under the same network. On the other hand, users with multiple robots running at the same time may want to be able to select to which robot to communicate from their laptop, while still preventing them to communicate between each other. The following sections will describe how to mitigate and solve these problems. Different solutions are presented, as each is suitable for different scenarios. ROS 2 Namespaces The easiest way to prevent multiple ROS 2 processes from communicating with each other is to use ROS 2 namespaces. As you may know, each ROS 2 entity is uniquely identified by its name (for example the topic named cmd_vel is used to control the robot). By specifying a namespace for a ROS 2 process you are effectively pre-pending a word in front of the name of all the entities created by it. The ROS 2 namespace can be set from the Application \u2192 Configuration menu in the Create\u00ae 3 robot's web server. Note that the namespace name must start with a slash / . If you have two robots and you specify the following namespaces: /robot_1 and /robot_2 you will then be able to see their individual topics well-separated: $ ros2 topic list /robot_1/cmd_vel /robot_1/dock /robot_1/odom ... /robot_2/cmd_vel /robot_2/dock /robot_2/odom ... Note that if you want to publish or subscribe to a specific topic, now you have to prepend the appropriate namespace in front of it. For example: $ ros2 topic echo /robot_1/odom Using a custom ROS 2 namespace for your robots is the recommended solution if you don't have too many robots or if you have an additional application that needs to communicate with all of them at the same time. ROS 2 Domain IDs A different approach for isolating multiple ROS 2 processes consists in specifying the ROS_DOMAIN_ID environment variable. If two processes use a different ROS_DOMAIN_ID value they will be completely isolated from each other, which means that they will not only avoid communication, but they also will not be able to discover each other. You can read more details about this variable in the ROS 2 official documentation . The ROS 2 domain ID can be set from the Application \u2192 Configuration menu in the Create\u00ae 3 robot's web server. Note that the domain ID must be a value between 0 and 101. By default, ROS 2 processes use a ROS_DOMAIN_ID value of 0. If you want to communicate with a specific robot from your laptop, it is required to set the corresponding value for the domain ID. For example: $ export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42 $ ros2 topic list /cmd_vel /dock /odom ... Note that a ROS 2 process can only use one domain ID at a time. If needed you can always have multiple robots under the same domain ID and then also add namespaces to prevent them from communicating. Using a custom ROS 2 domain ID for your robots is the recommended solution when you have a large number of robots and you want your tools to communicate only with a subset of them.","title":"Multi-Robot Setup"},{"location":"setup/multi-robot/#using-multiple-create-3-robots","text":"This page describes how to manage multiple Create\u00ae 3 robots connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
